Description

The visualization framework is proposed to help users to explore high dimensional brain subregion volume changes and its relationship with Huntinton's disease.
Huntington’s disease(HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease which is caused by a known 
genetic pathology in Huntington’s protein. Clinical symptoms of HD include motor, cognitive 
and psychiatric abilities of patients. HD diagnosis is determined based on unequivocal 
movement disorder. Despite of an utmost demand of identifying features which can be used 
as a biomarker of the HD progression prior to disease manifestation, significant features 
have not yet been discovered. Most of previous HD studies relied on brain sub­region 
volumes, especially in a striatum, to show the correlation of the degeneration of brain and 
HD progression. Although the degeneration is most significantly observed in a striatum, the 
other parts of brain also degenerate while HD progresses. Also, the brain sub­regions are 
not independent from each other since they are all connected and adjacent. HD does not 
only affect the particular sub­regions of brains as already discovered, but it might also affect 
the other parts of brain. Thus, the relationship of changes in brain sub­regions and HD 
progression is complicated since there are numerous sub­regions which results in high 
dimensional features. CAP score, which is the product of age and a gene status, is suggested 
as the estimated HD progression score in clinical studies. Prodromal HD patients are classified 
into different risk groups (controls, low, medium, and high groups) based on their CAP scores. 
Although a few recent studies have been published to support the relationship between CAP 
scores and prodromal HD progression, solid proofs have not been suggested. Thus, the clinical 
risk group analysis based on CAP score needs more supports from data to prove the correlation 
to prodromal HD progression. 

 In the proposed framework, we want to offer users to have an idea how brain subregion volume 
changes are related with HD risk burdens by projecting patients’ data to a space with user 
selected subregions. We aim to let users explore patients’ data by projecting data to a selected 
2D space with brain subregions and patients’ age. The proposed framework offers the 
information of the correlation between brain subregions and HD risk score(CAP score) and the 
correlation in between brain subregion volume changes to help them to identify interesting brain 
subregions they want to investigate.
